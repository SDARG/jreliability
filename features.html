          <h2>Features</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h4>Easy and Safe Modeling</h4>
				<p><em>JReliability</em> features an easy modeling of the system as Boolean Functions represented as mathematical terms.
				Transparent for the user and, thus, hiding complexity, <em>JReliability</em> uses Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as an intermediate format to directly transform the user-built terms into a reliability function of the overall system.
				Since 2017, <a href="http://javabdd.sourceforge.net/">JBDD</a> is the supported BDD back-end.
				As an alternative to BDDs, <em>JReliability</em> now also offers the use of a stochastic logic-based success/fault-tree analysis that delivers decent approximative results in case BDDs outgrow the available memory.
				</p>
			<h4>Powerful Analyzis</h4>
				<p>With <em>JReliability</em>, a set of powerful and fast analyzers is delivered that are able to automatically determine common reliability-related measures like Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF), Mission-Time (MT), failure rates and many more from a given system model.
				Besides overall reliability-related measures, <em>JReliability</em> also has a rich set of importance measures available that judge the importance of individual components for coherent and non-coherent systems.
				Lots of analytical evaluation methods are included with the number of included evaluators steadily growing.
				For the modeling of the system component's properties, a large set of predefined common reliability functions are available. Of course, user defined reliability functions can be seamlessly included.</p>

				</p>
			<h4>Demonstrative Visualization</h4>
				<p>The framework contains a GUI for the visualization of the measures as well as a function to plot the terms and, if needed, also to plot the BDDs respresenting system structure using <em>dot</em>.</p>
                                <p>

				</p>
			<h4>Open Source and Development</h4>
				<p>The library is <a href="https://github.com/sdarg/jreliability">open source</a> 
				and released under the LGPL license allowing the integration into scientific, 
				educational, and commercial projects.
				Moreover, the development of specific solutions based on <em>JReliability</em> is simplified by the usage of Java features like Generics.
				The library code is pure Java and free of any text-based configuration files or boilerplate code.
