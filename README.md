# JReliability - The Java-based Reliability Library

JReliability allows to derive several reliability-related measures like Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF) or Mission-Time (MT) of complex systems that are modeled using Boolean functions, efficiently encoded in Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs).

## Usage
JReliability is meant to be used as library. Nonetheless, there is a small demo application you can use to get an initial idea and to demonstrate the included viewers.

### Linux/Unix
Run:

	./start.sh

### Windows
Run:

	./start.bat

## Developer
JReliability uses Gradle. Run

	./gradlew tasks

to show all available tasks.

Use

	./gradlew eclipse

to create the required .project and .classpath files to import the project in Eclipse.

Use

	./gradlew run

to execute the demo application.
